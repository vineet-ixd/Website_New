                My research interest lies in Augmented/ Mixed/ Virtual Reality and I have worked on various projects in AR/MR/VR. Currently, I am working on a project based on Collaborative Mixed Reality, which aims to design a platform to enhance the collaborative working in AEC Industry (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) using Mixed Reality. <br/><br/>
